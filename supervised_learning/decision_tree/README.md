# <p align="center">Decision Tree</p>

## 🎯 Description

This project implements decision tree algorithms from scratch. It includes tree construction, splitting criteria, prediction and advanced techniques like random forests and isolation forests for anomaly detection.

## ⚙️ Technologies

python3 (version 3.9)  
numpy (version 1.25.2)
